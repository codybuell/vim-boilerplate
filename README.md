Vim Boilerplate
===============

Basic configuration scaffolding for those first starting out in vim.  Out of
the box vim isn't particularly friendly, these dotfiles are meant to ease the
initial transition without changing any core functionality or mappings.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/codybuell/vim-boilerplate.git`
2. Pull down submodules `cd vim-boilerplate; git submodule init; git submodule update`
3. Place the dotfiles `make awesome`

Plugins Worth Checking Out

    more!  Very fast, highly recommended.
